# Chapter 13: The de Sitter Patch

## 13.1 The Intuitive Picture: The Universe Is Static or Decelerating

Start with the old cosmological picture.

**The intuitive picture**: The universe is either static (things stay roughly as they are) or decelerating (gravity pulls everything together, slowing expansion). This is the natural expectation from Newton through Einstein.

Einstein himself added a "cosmological constant" to his equations in 1917 to create a static universe-a universe that neither expanded nor contracted. When Hubble discovered the universe is expanding, Einstein dropped the constant, calling it his "greatest blunder."

Even after accepting expansion, the expectation was deceleration. Gravity attracts. The mutual pull of all the matter in the universe should slow the expansion, like a ball thrown upward gradually slowing. Eventually, the expansion might stop or even reverse.

Supernova data broke that picture.

## 13.2 The Surprising Hint: The Universe Is Accelerating

### The 1998 Supernova Observations

In January 1998, two teams of astronomers independently announced results that overturned our understanding of the cosmos.

Saul Perlmutter led the Supernova Cosmology Project. Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess led the High-Z Supernova Search Team. Both groups had spent years hunting Type Ia supernovae-the "standard candles" of cosmology.

Everyone expected to find that expansion is slowing. The data showed the opposite.

Distant supernovae were fainter than expected-farther away than a decelerating universe would predict. The universe isn't slowing down. It's **speeding up**.

Something is pushing the cosmos apart. Something is fighting gravity and winning. The teams called it "dark energy."

### The Cosmological Constant Returns

A positive cosmological constant Lambda > 0 creates a kind of "anti-gravity"-a repulsive force that grows with distance. At early times, when matter density was high, gravity dominated. But as the universe expanded and matter diluted, Lambda took over.

The expansion began accelerating about 5 billion years ago. The universe is about 68% dark energy.

The universe has a positive cosmological constant. It is accelerating toward a de Sitter future.

## 13.3 The First-Principles Reframing: De Sitter Is the Natural Screen

Reverse engineering asks why nature has a positive cosmological constant. What principle makes de Sitter space natural?

### The Static Patch

What does one observer actually experience in de Sitter space?

As you look outward, galaxies recede faster and faster. At a critical distance $r_H = c/H$, the recession velocity equals the speed of light. Beyond this radius, light can never reach you.

This defines your **cosmological horizon**-the boundary of your causal access.

Inside the horizon, you can use static coordinates. This region-the **static patch**-is all of de Sitter space that you can ever access.

### De Sitter Fits Our Framework

**The de Sitter horizon is the natural holographic screen.**

| Framework Element | De Sitter Property |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Observers have finite patches | The static patch is bounded by horizon |
| Patch boundary is $S^2$ | The horizon is topologically a 2-sphere |
| Finite entropy | Gibbons-Hawking entropy $S = A/(4\ell_P^2)$ |
| No "God's eye view" | No observer sees beyond their horizon |
| Observer equivalence | De Sitter is maximally symmetric |
| Time is emergent | No preferred global time; time is patch-dependent |

The static patch is not a limitation to be overcome. It's the natural arena for physics from an observer's perspective.

## 13.4 The Gibbons-Hawking Temperature

In 1977, Gary Gibbons and Stephen Hawking proved that the cosmological horizon radiates like a black body:

$$T_{dS} = \frac{\hbar H}{2\pi k_B}$$

For our universe, this is about 10^{-30} Kelvin-undetectable. During inflation, horizon-scale quantum fluctuations were stretched and later seeded structure formation; the de Sitter temperature is one thermodynamic way of characterizing that regime.

This temperature does not mean that empty space is glowing brightly around us. It means that an observer confined to one static patch sees the horizon as a thermal environment. Part of the quantum state is inaccessible beyond the horizon, and that loss of access has the same thermodynamic signature that horizons have elsewhere in gravitational physics.

### Why This Temperature? The Unruh Connection

The Gibbons-Hawking and Unruh formulas are closely related, but the identification has to be stated carefully.

A geodesic observer at the center of the static patch has zero proper acceleration, while a generic observer held at fixed radius has a radius-dependent proper acceleration. Near a horizon, the local de Sitter temperature reduces to the corresponding Unruh form:

$$T_U = \frac{\hbar a}{2\pi c k_B}$$

So the de Sitter and Unruh temperatures are locally linked, but they should not be identified by assigning every static-patch observer the same acceleration $a = cH$.

This has an important implication for our model: **de Sitter horizons automatically satisfy the same thermodynamic relations as Rindler horizons**. We don't need to prove this-Gibbons and Hawking did.

### Finite Entropy

If the horizon has temperature, it must have entropy:

$$S_{dS} = \frac{A}{4\ell_P^2} = \frac{\pi c^5}{G\hbar H^2}$$

This is the entropy associated with one de Sitter static patch-the logarithm of the effective number of states accessible within that patch.

That is the practical meaning of the formula. It is a capacity statement. The patch does not contain an infinite amount of information hidden in a smooth continuum. It contains a finite number of distinguishable states, and the area of the horizon tells you how large that state space can be.

This finite entropy has major implications. At minimum, an observer's accessible patch has finite information capacity. Stronger global-finiteness statements require additional assumptions.

### Why This Matters for Gravity

Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's equations requires that horizons have:
1. Temperature proportional to surface gravity
2. Entropy proportional to area
3. The first law of thermodynamics

De Sitter thermodynamics supplies the temperature and area-entropy data needed for this route. In our model this is part of the calibration: combined with the geometric time-flow and entanglement-equilibrium steps from earlier chapters, it supports the emergence of Einstein's equation from observer-patch consistency on the holographic screen.

## 13.5 The Problem of Time in De Sitter

In Anti-de Sitter space, there's a boundary at spatial infinity that provides a universal time reference.

De Sitter has no spatial boundary. The only boundary is the horizon-and the horizon is observer-dependent.

### Horizon Complementarity

Leonard Susskind and collaborators proposed **de Sitter complementarity**: operationally, physics should be described patch by patch rather than by privileging a single global observer description.

Alice describes physics in her patch using her Hilbert space. Bob describes physics in his patch using his Hilbert space. Where their patches overlap, their descriptions must be consistent. In the complementarity reading adopted here, patch-relative descriptions are primary.

This fits naturally with our model. Reality is a collection of consistent patches. You can't step outside and view the universe from nowhere.

## 13.6 Static Patch Holography

Where should we put the holographic screen in de Sitter?

The natural answer: on the cosmological horizon.

For an observer at $r = 0$, the horizon is a sphere at $r = c/H$. This sphere has area $4\pi c^2/H^2$ and entropy of order $10^{122}$ in natural units, or $10^{122}/\ln 2$ bits.

The three-dimensional bulk inside the horizon is encoded holographically on the two-dimensional horizon.

When an object falls toward the horizon, it gets redshifted and appears to freeze onto the surface, its information smeared across the screen.

This is why the horizon is the natural screen in this chapter. It is the last place where an observer can still trade signals with the rest of the patch. If the book's general claim is that physics is organized around what observers can compare, then the cosmological horizon is exactly where that comparison structure has to live.

### Why This Is Not "dS/CFT"

When physicists say "de Sitter holography is unsolved," they typically mean: we don't have an AdS/CFT-like duality with a clean boundary CFT at infinity. The classic dS/CFT proposal puts a Euclidean CFT at future infinity, but this leads to notorious problems-potential non-unitarity, complex weights, and no clear operational access for any observer.

Our model takes a different path entirely. We're not trying to do "AdS/CFT but with positive Lambda." We're doing **static patch holography**:

| What dS/CFT attempts | What we do |
|----------------------|------------|
| Boundary at future infinity | Boundary is the observer's horizon |
| Global CFT dual to the bulk | Only local algebras + consistency |
| One description for all observers | Each observer has their own horizon screen |
| Fights de Sitter's observer-dependence | Embraces it as fundamental |

This is a fundamental shift in target. The "unsolved problem" of dS holography is about finding a global boundary theory at infinity. We solve a different problem: how do local observer patches, each bounded by a horizon, yield consistent physics?

### Lambda as Global Capacity

A crucial insight: the cosmological constant cannot be determined by local consistency conditions. This follows from the mathematics-null modular data can only reconstruct the stress tensor up to a term proportional to the metric. Any term Lambda times g_ab is invisible to local null probes.

So Lambda must be fixed by a **global** constraint: the total capacity of the screen. In natural units, the relationship is:

$$\Lambda = \frac{3\pi}{G \cdot \log(\dim \mathcal{H}_{\text{tot}})}$$

We don't predict Lambda. We use the observed Lambda to infer screen capacity. Lambda is a global parameter. It is not derivable from local physics, and it encodes the total capacity of the holographic screen.

### Many Observers, One Lambda

The philosophical stance of our model-"no objective reality, only subjective perspectives that must agree on overlaps"-maps naturally onto de Sitter static patch intuition. Each timelike observer has their own horizon, their own patch. There's no operational access to a single global description.

But Lambda is the one thing that **can** be shared across overlaps. It's a global capacity constraint that all consistent overlapping descriptions inherit. Different observers see different patches, but they all see the same Lambda-encoded in the finite size of their horizons.

### The Claim Boundary

The cosmology claim is conditional, and it is easier to understand in plain language than in theorem shorthand. If the entropy-maximizing state is rotationally symmetric for an observer, then the large-scale stress tensor looks like a perfect fluid. If the same isotropy holds across observers, the spatial slices have constant curvature. Combine that with the gravity relation from the earlier chapters and a positive cosmological constant, and you recover the familiar FLRW form used in cosmology.

The important caution is simple. The bare OPH axioms do not force every possible cosmological branch into that symmetric sector. The book's claim is narrower: once that sector is selected, the standard large-scale cosmological geometry follows.

## 13.7 Scrambling and Chaos

De Sitter space is a **fast scrambler**-perhaps the fastest possible.

Information sent toward the horizon gets thermalized, mixed with all the other quantum information. The scrambling time is:

$$t_{scrambling} \sim \frac{1}{H}\ln S \sim \frac{280}{H}$$

For our universe, this is about 4 trillion years. Black holes are the standard saturators of the chaos bound in holographic settings, and de Sitter is often discussed as a fast-scrambling horizon with analogous scaling.

The smooth, empty appearance of the de Sitter vacuum can be read as highly scrambled information in this perspective.

## 13.8 The Swampland and Anthropic Selection

String theory has difficulty producing stable de Sitter vacua.

Swampland arguments suggest that stable de Sitter vacua may be impossible in consistent quantum gravity. If true, our universe would be slowly rolling down a potential hill.

Even if de Sitter vacua exist, why is Lambda so small (10^{-122} in Planck units)?

The **anthropic principle** offers an answer: if Lambda were much larger, galaxies couldn't form. If it were negative, the universe would recollapse. We find ourselves in a universe with small positive Lambda because that's where observers can exist.

## 13.9 Reverse Engineering Summary

The picture so far:

| Intuitive Picture | Surprising Hint | First-Principles Reframing |
|---|---|---|
| The universe is static or decelerating; gravity should slow expansion | 1998 supernova observations: the universe is accelerating; positive cosmological constant Lambda | De Sitter horizon is the natural holographic screen; the static patch is the observer's arena; finite entropy and horizon complementarity fit our model naturally |

Cosmic expansion does not have to decelerate. The supernova data and positive cosmological constant point to de Sitter behavior, and de Sitter space fits the observer-first picture naturally: the cosmological horizon acts as the holographic screen, the static patch is the operational arena, and finite entropy plus horizon complementarity belong to the same structure.

**Additional lessons**:

1. **Accelerating Expansion**: The universe is 68% dark energy with Lambda > 0.

2. **Static Patch**: Each observer is bounded by a cosmological horizon at $r = c/H$.

3. **Gibbons-Hawking**: The horizon has temperature $T = \hbar H / (2\pi k_B)$ and entropy $S = A / (4\ell_P^2)$.

4. **Finite Patch Entropy**: A de Sitter static patch carries entropy of order $10^{122}$ in natural units, so an observer's accessible region has finite information capacity.

5. **Horizon Complementarity**: Patch-relative descriptions are primary, and consistency is enforced on overlaps rather than through a single preferred global observer description.

6. **Fast Scrambling**: De Sitter is often discussed as a fast-scrambling horizon with scaling analogous to the black-hole case.

7. **Swampland and Anthropics**: The small value of Lambda remains open; anthropic and dynamical ideas are both discussed in the literature.

## 13.10 Dark Sector as a Modular-Anomaly Branch

There's another cosmic mystery we haven't addressed: dark matter. Galaxies rotate too fast. Galaxy clusters hold together too tightly. The cosmic microwave background fluctuations require extra gravitational pull. The standard explanation: invisible particles that interact gravitationally but not electromagnetically.

Our framework suggests a different, program-level branch.

### The Modular Anomaly

In Chapter 11, we saw that a first-variation Einstein relation, later upgraded to the semiclassical Einstein equation, emerges from an entanglement-equilibrium argument in the scaling regime. But that derivation assumed perfect Markov structure-perfect recoverability across patch overlaps.

In reality, the Markov condition is only approximate. There's always some residual correlation that can't be perfectly captured by the boundary alone. This imperfection appears as an extra term:

$$K_C = 2\pi B_C + K_C^{(\text{anom})} + \text{const}$$

where the "anomaly" captures the deviation from perfect modular additivity. This anomaly contributes to the stress-energy:

$$G_{00} + \Lambda g_{00} = 8\pi G \left( \langle T_{00} \rangle + \langle T_{00}^{\text{anom}} \rangle \right)$$

The coefficient is fixed by the derivation: $\frac{15}{8\pi^2} \approx 0.19$.

### Why This Is "Dark"

The anomalous term $T_{00}^{\text{anom}}$ is "dark" by construction:

- It arises from information-theoretic structure, not from Standard Model fields
- It gravitates (appears on the right side of Einstein's equation)
- It doesn't couple electromagnetically (it's not made of charged particles)

This gives the anomaly sector the right structural profile for a dark component.

### The Acceleration Scale

Here's the key insight. The de Sitter horizon introduces an unavoidable IR length scale:

$$r_{dS} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{\Lambda}} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{26} \text{ m}$$

Galaxy rotation anomalies are an IR phenomenon-they appear at large distances where accelerations are tiny. Any modification from the modular anomaly must be controlled by this scale.

A natural acceleration benchmark, carrying the anomaly coefficient, is:

$$a_0^{(\text{OPH})} = \frac{15}{8\pi^2} \cdot \frac{c^2}{r_{dS}}$$

Plugging in numbers:

$$a_0^{(\text{OPH})} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$$

This lands near the empirical MOND acceleration scale $a_0 \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ $\text{m/s}^2$ that fits galaxy rotation curves, which is why the branch is interesting. This proximity is not a derived galaxy-dynamics result.

### What This Continuation Benchmarks

One possible continuation ansatz is to identify the modular anomaly with part of the inferred dark sector. Under that extra ansatz:

**A MOND-like scaling could be postulated.** In the deep IR regime where $g < a_0$, one might write the effective gravitational acceleration as:

$$g_{\text{obs}} \approx \sqrt{a_0 \cdot g_b}$$

where $g_b$ is the Newtonian acceleration from baryons. For a galaxy, this would give $v \propto r^0$-flat rotation curves in the ansatz.

**The Baryonic Tully-Fisher relation becomes a benchmark target.** The asymptotic rotation velocity would then satisfy:

$$V^4 = G \cdot M_b \cdot a_0^{(\text{OPH})}$$

This has the observed Tully-Fisher form in the ansatz, with a benchmark normalization set by screen capacity.

**No new particles are required at the level of the ansatz.** The "dark matter" would be an effective correction to gravity at large scales, not a new species of particle.

### The Status

This continuation branch lies outside the recovered core. It gives:

- The modular anomaly term exists with a fixed coefficient
- The de Sitter scale $r_{dS}$ is determined by screen capacity
- The combination gives an acceleration scale in the right ballpark

What remains missing:

- A controlled nonrelativistic reduction from the anomaly term to galaxy and lensing observables
- A derived source/response law selecting the MOND-like scaling rather than alternative IR behavior
- Cluster and Bullet-Cluster phenomenology
- Cosmological abundance and structure-formation analysis
- Environment-dependence and stability checks

So the claim is narrower: the same finite screen capacity that gives us the cosmological constant also supplies an IR benchmark scale for a possible dark-sector continuation. The continuation itself is open.

### What A Full Closure Would Need To Face

A full closure would need to explain whether an acceleration scale near $a_0^{(\text{OPH})} \approx 1.03 \times 10^{-10}$ $\text{m/s}^2$ can coexist with galaxy, lensing, cluster, Bullet-Cluster, and cosmological data. The branch is open.

---

We've established the arena: a finite static patch bounded by a holographic horizon. But what populates this arena? What are the particles and forces we observe, and why do they have the peculiar properties they do?

In the next chapter, we'll see that the Standard Model of particle physics is not fundamental. It **emerges from consistency requirements**-the gluing conditions between observer patches force gauge symmetry, and the requirement for anomaly-free gluing determines the particle content.

This is **Chapter 14: The Standard Model from Consistency**.
