# Chapter 3: The Screen and the Sphere

## 3.1 The Volume Hint

Here's what seems obvious about information: more space should hold more data.

A bigger hard drive stores more files. A bigger warehouse holds more boxes. A bigger brain should hold more memories. The amount of stuff you can fit into a container should scale with its volume.

This is the **intuitive picture**: information content scales with volume.

$$\text{Information} \propto V$$

If you have a box and you divide it in half, each half should hold half the information. If you double the size of a room, you should be able to fit twice as many things in it.

This seems so obvious that nobody questioned it for most of physics history.

And it's wrong.

The universe gave us a hint-a spectacular, unexpected hint-that information doesn't work this way at all. The hint came from the strangest objects in the cosmos: black holes.

## 3.2 The Teacup Problem: The Hint

In 1972, a graduate student named Jacob Bekenstein walked into John Wheeler's office at Princeton with a simple thought experiment.

Imagine a cup of hot tea. The tea has entropy-it is hot and messy, with many microscopic arrangements of molecules that produce the same macroscopic state.

Lower the cup into a black hole.

The tea crosses the event horizon and vanishes. No one outside can ever see it again. If the tea is gone, so is its entropy. The total entropy of the observable universe has decreased.

But wait. The Second Law of Thermodynamics says total entropy never decreases. The Second Law is the rule that makes time flow in a direction. It tells you why broken glasses don't unbreak, why scrambled eggs don't unscramble, why we remember the past but not the future.

If a black hole can erase entropy, the Second Law is wrong.

### Bekenstein's Bold Response

Bekenstein proposed that black holes must have entropy. When the tea falls in, the entropy doesn't disappear-it shows up as an increase in the black hole's own entropy.

But where could a black hole's entropy hide?

Black holes are supposed to be simple. In general relativity, a black hole is fully described by just three numbers: its mass, its electric charge, and its spin. Wheeler called this the "no-hair theorem"-black holes have no distinguishing features.

So where are the microstates? Where is the internal structure that entropy requires?

Bekenstein looked at the only thing that changes when you throw stuff in: the size of the event horizon. He made a guess-an educated guess, constrained by dimensional analysis and theoretical consistency-that the entropy is proportional to the **area** of the horizon:

$$S \propto A$$

Not the volume. The area.

### Hawking Confirms It

Stephen Hawking was skeptical. He set out to prove Bekenstein wrong by showing black holes have no temperature.

He studied quantum fields near a black hole horizon. What he found shocked him.

The vacuum of quantum field theory seethes with virtual particle pairs that pop into existence and annihilate. Near a horizon, one particle can fall in while the other escapes. To a distant observer, the black hole emits radiation-**Hawking radiation**.

Hawking calculated the temperature:

$$T_H = \frac{\hbar c^3}{8\pi G M k_B}$$

Once a black hole has temperature, it must have entropy. From thermodynamics, Hawking derived:

$$S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4 \ell_P^2}$$

where $\ell_P = \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3} \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ m is the Planck length.

The entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area, measured in Planck units.

### The Surprising Conclusion

**The hint**: Information scales with area, not volume.

**The lesson**: The intuitive picture-that information content scales with the size of a container-is fundamentally wrong. Black-hole entropy and related bounds push strongly toward a boundary-sensitive description.

**The first-principles reframing**: The 3D world we experience may not be the fundamental level. The bulk may be emergent and reconstructed from boundary data.

## 3.3 Why Entropy Points to the Boundary

Entropy counts how many microscopic arrangements fit one macroscopic description. Chapter 4 develops that idea carefully. The screen chapter needs one narrower lesson.

For black holes, the entropy is set by horizon area:

$$S_{BH} = \frac{A}{4 \ell_P^2}.$$

That is the surprise. The natural counting measure for the most extreme gravitating objects is area, not volume. Once that is true, any observer-centered account of accessible information has to take boundaries seriously.

Bekenstein sharpened the point further. Pack enough energy into a region and the region becomes a black hole. The black hole then supplies the maximum entropy compatible with that size. Area becomes the natural ceiling for accessible information in gravitational settings.

## 3.4 From Area Scaling to Holography

This is the jump from thermodynamics to geometry.

If the largest possible entropy in a region is controlled by its boundary, a boundary-first description stops looking like a metaphor. It becomes the natural bookkeeping choice. The bulk may still be the world we experience, but the independent data is organized more economically on the boundary.

This is the holographic idea in its simplest form. A two-dimensional surface can encode a three-dimensional description, just as a hologram stores depth information on a film.

Chapter 8 returns to holography in full. For the present chapter, the conclusion is simpler. The horizon is the right place to organize the data available to an observer.

## 3.5 Black Holes and Horizons

Let's make sure we understand what a horizon is-and why every observer has one.

### The Event Horizon

A black hole is not a physical object in the usual sense-it's a region of spacetime. The **event horizon** is the boundary of that region. Once you cross it, you cannot escape.

The Schwarzschild radius of a black hole of mass $M$ is:

$$R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$$

For the Sun, this is about 3 kilometers. For Earth, it's about 9 millimeters. Any mass compressed within its Schwarzschild radius becomes a black hole.

The horizon is not a physical surface. You could cross it without noticing anything special. But once you're inside, the geometry of spacetime is such that all paths-even light paths-lead inward.

Here's a way to think about it: near a black hole, space is falling inward like a waterfall. The event horizon is where the water falls faster than you can swim.

### Other Horizons

Black holes are not the only source of horizons.

**Cosmological horizons**: The universe is expanding, and cosmology distinguishes the observable-universe scale from the future event horizon. The key point here is that there are regions from which light cannot reach us, so observer access is finite.

**Acceleration horizons**: If you accelerate continuously, there is a region behind you from which light can never catch up. You have a **Rindler horizon**. This produces the **Unruh effect**: an accelerating observer perceives the vacuum as a warm bath of particles.

In each case, the horizon is a boundary that limits what the observer can access. It is the edge of their observable universe.

### Every Observer Has a Screen

Here's the key motivating insight: finite observer access naturally suggests an effective screen picture.

For an observer in our universe:
- There is an observer-dependent cosmological horizon scale
- If they're near a black hole, there's an event horizon
- If they're accelerating, there's a Rindler horizon

In the simplest symmetric situations, the relevant causal boundary is approximately spherical. The area of this sphere bounds the amount of information the observer can access.

This is a deep shift in perspective. Instead of thinking about space as a fixed container, we think about each observer's horizon as their fundamental interface with reality.

## 3.6 Why a Sphere?

In the symmetric cases used to motivate this construction, the screen is naturally modeled as (approximately) spherical. This choice follows from causal light-cone geometry in those cases.

Light travels at the same speed in all directions. If you stand at a point and wait, the light that can reach you from a time $t$ ago forms a sphere of radius $ct$ around you.

Your past light cone-the set of events that could have influenced you-has spherical cross-sections. Your future light cone also has spherical cross-sections.

In those symmetric light-cone constructions, the sphere is a consequence of the geometry of causality.

### The Cosmic Microwave Background

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) illustrates this beautifully.

The CMB is light from about 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the universe cooled enough for atoms to form and light to travel freely. This light appears as a sphere around us-the **last scattering surface**.

We're at the center of this sphere, but so is everyone else. Every observer in the universe sees themselves at the center of their own CMB sphere.

The CMB sphere is a useful cosmological proxy for thinking about an observer-centered screen picture. It is one especially vivid example of how observer-accessible information can be organized on an apparent 2D sky.

## 3.7 The Geometry of the 2-Sphere

The mathematical object describing the screen is the 2-sphere, $S^2$.

$$S^2 = \{(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 : x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\}$$

We can parameterize it with spherical coordinates $(\theta, \phi)$:
- $\theta$ is the polar angle, from 0 at the North Pole to $\pi$ at the South Pole
- $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle, from 0 to $2\pi$ around the equator

The metric is:

$$ds^2 = d\theta^2 + \sin^2\theta \, d\phi^2$$

### Spherical Harmonics

Any function on the sphere can be expanded in **spherical harmonics**, $Y_\ell^m(\theta, \phi)$. These are the natural modes of vibration of the sphere.

The CMB temperature variations are analyzed by expanding in spherical harmonics. The **power spectrum**-how much power at each angular scale $\ell$-tells us about the early universe.

### Finite Resolution

If one adopts a smallest screen length scale as a finite-cutoff modeling assumption, then there is a maximum $\ell$:

$$\ell_{max} \sim \frac{R}{\ell_P}$$

The total number of independent modes is roughly $\ell_{max}^2 \sim R^2/\ell_P^2$-proportional to area in Planck units, in line with the area scaling suggested by Bekenstein-Hawking.

In such a finite-resolution screen model, our experience of a continuous world is an approximation and the screen description becomes effectively discretized.

## 3.8 Patches and Overlaps

You cannot see the whole screen. Some parts are hidden by your horizon or by instrumental limits. You only access a **patch**-a portion of the sphere.

Another observer, at a different location or with different instruments, accesses a different patch. Where patches overlap, observers can compare notes.

If the screen is a sphere $S^2$ and observer $i$ sees patch $P_i$, then two observers can compare data on the overlap $P_i \cap P_j$. That overlap is the seed of consistency.

### A Concrete Example

Consider two astronomers on opposite sides of Earth. During the night, they see different parts of the sky. But some stars are visible to both-stars near the horizon for each observer.

These shared stars provide a link. The astronomers can calibrate by comparing their observations of the overlap region. Once they agree on the overlap, they can combine their observations into a consistent map of the whole sky.

### Coordinate Charts and Atlases

A sphere cannot be covered by a single smooth coordinate system. If you try to put latitude-longitude coordinates on a sphere, you run into problems at the poles.

Mathematicians handle this by using multiple overlapping coordinate charts, called an **atlas**. Each chart covers part of the sphere. Where charts overlap, there are transition functions that tell you how to convert coordinates.

This is exactly analogous to our observer patches. Each observer has a local description. Where observers overlap, they must agree on how to translate between their descriptions.

Physics is the art of finding descriptions that work in many charts and have consistent translations between them.

## 3.9 What Is an Observer?

We've talked about "observers" and their "patches." But what exactly IS an observer in this model?

### Not External Watchers

In classical physics, observers are implicitly outside the system-disembodied measurers who don't affect what they measure. This won't work here. Observers must be part of the system they observe.

### Observers as Patterns in the Data

An observer is a special kind of pattern in the horizon data-a subsystem with three key properties:

**1. Bounded access**: The observer can only interact with a finite patch P of the screen. This patch defines what the observer can measure, know, and act upon. The boundary of the patch is the observer's horizon.

**2. Stable records**: The observer contains internal correlations that persist over time-memory. When you measure something and remember the result, your brain has become correlated with the measured system. These correlations are the "records" that define measurement outcomes.

**3. Self-modeling**: An observer can build compressed representations of its environment. Your brain doesn't store raw sensory data; it builds a model of the world.

### The Vortex Analogy

Think of observers as stable vortices in a fluid.

The fluid is the quantum state on the horizon-constantly evolving, highly correlated. A vortex isn't separate from the fluid; it's a pattern within the fluid. It persists over time. It has a definite location. It interacts with other patterns.

An observer is like that. It's not a ghostly presence watching from outside. It's a stable, self-reinforcing pattern within the data on the screen. The pattern has access to a local region (its patch), maintains internal structure (its records), and can interact with nearby patterns (other observers, measured systems).

### Movement and Time

Do observers "move around" on the sphere?

Not in a simple sense. Different patches represent different observers, or the same observer at different moments. "Movement" is actually a sequence of overlapping patches with consistent marginals.

What creates the sense of time? The internal structure of the quantum state provides a natural flow: the **modular flow** from quantum statistical mechanics. For a thermal state, modular flow generates time evolution, and the thermal time principle provides an important interpretive-organizational guide.

### Why This Matters

This definition of observers resolves several puzzles:

**No external reference frame**: Observers are internal to the system, so there's no need for an external "God's-eye view."

**Measurement is physical**: When an observer measures something, correlations form between subsystems within the horizon data and stable records are created. That record formation captures the main physical content behind textbook collapse language.

**Consistency follows from structure**: In the constructive screen picture, if two observers are modeled as patterns in the same underlying state, their reduced descriptions must agree on overlaps. The more general gluing story is subtler and is developed later.

### Reality from Computation

Here's a concrete way to think about the screen and its observers.

Imagine the screen as a **gauge-invariant quantum system** on the 2-sphere, something like a quantum cellular automaton but with important structure. Triangulate the sphere into tiny cells. At each edge of the triangulation sits a finite-dimensional quantum system (a qudit). At each vertex, a gauge constraint (Gauss's law) restricts which configurations are physical. Not all states survive; only those satisfying the constraint at every vertex.

**Observer patches** are subsystems defined by boundary-gauge-invariant algebras. Each patch is like a computational thread, a connected region where an observer can ask questions and get answers. The algebra $\mathcal{A}(R)$ defines what that observer can measure: the operators that commute with the boundary gauge transformations.

**Overlap consistency** is built into this constructive picture. Where two patches intersect, they access the same gauge-invariant observables. Both observers are reading the same underlying data, just from different angles. The gauge redundancy at boundaries is what makes gluing non-trivial and gives rise to the "edge modes" that carry geometric information.

**The dynamics** comes from MaxEnt: among all states consistent with the constraints, nature selects the maximum entropy state. This is like a Gibbs state $\rho \propto e^{-H}$ where $H$ is a sum of local terms. The system thermalizes at the UV scale, and the macroscopic physics emerges from this equilibrium.

**The 4D bulk isn't on the sphere.** It emerges from the entanglement structure between patches. When you look around and see three-dimensional space, you're experiencing a compressed encoding of how your patch is entangled with others. Distance in the bulk is entanglement on the boundary.

*The screen is the computation. Observer patches are the threads. Reality is what they agree on.*

This computational picture is developed concretely through **quantum link models**, a class of lattice gauge theories with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces that provide an explicit UV realization of key OPH ingredients. The technical details are in the paper; the intuition is that the sphere is running a quantum computation, and we are processes within it.

## 3.10 Entanglement Creates Depth

The screen gives a boundary. It does not yet explain why experience feels three-dimensional. The missing ingredient is entanglement.

When parts of a quantum state are strongly correlated, they behave as one connected structure. In holographic settings this relation becomes quantitative: boundary entanglement constrains bulk geometry. The Ryu-Takayanagi formula and related results make that statement precise in the regimes where they apply.

For the book, one lesson is enough here. Depth is read off from correlation structure. Strongly linked regions count as nearby in the emergent bulk. Weakly linked regions count as distant.

Chapter 9 develops this in detail. In the present chapter, entanglement does one job. It explains why a screen can support an interior world instead of a flat catalog of data.

## 3.11 The Reverse Engineering

Let's trace the reverse engineering explicitly.

**The intuitive picture**: Information scales with volume. Space is the fundamental container.

**The hint**: Black hole entropy scales with area, and gravitational entropy bounds point toward boundary-limited information.

**The lesson**: A boundary-first description becomes a strong candidate. On that reading, the boundary is primary and the bulk emergent.

**The first-principles reframing**:

1. In the symmetric constructions used here, each observer has an effective horizon that is naturally modeled by a spherical screen bounding accessible information
2. The screen carries the fundamental data, limited by $S \leq A/(4\ell_P^2)$
3. Entanglement patterns on the screen create the geometry of the emergent 3D bulk
4. Different observers have different screens, but consistency on overlaps makes the emergent 3D world shared and stable

The holographic principle is not introduced here as a philosophical preference. It is presented as the strongest explanatory reading of the hints reviewed in this chapter.

## 3.12 Pixel Limits

Let's put numbers on this.

The Planck length is $\ell_P \approx 1.6 \times 10^{-35}$ meters-about $10^{20}$ times smaller than a proton. The Planck area is $\ell_P^2 \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-70}$ m².

**The observable universe**: Radius $R \approx 4.4 \times 10^{26}$ m. Horizon area $A \approx 2.4 \times 10^{54}$ m². The corresponding entropy scale is of order $10^{122}$--$10^{123}$ in natural units, or smaller by a factor of $\ln 2$ when quoted in bits, depending on which horizon convention is being used.

This is a truly enormous number-but it is finite. The observable universe contains a finite amount of information.

**A solar-mass black hole**: Schwarzschild radius $R_s \approx 3$ km. Number of bits: $N \approx 10^{77}$.

This is still huge, but much smaller than the observable universe. Yet it's far more than the entropy of the Sun as a normal star (about $10^{58}$). Collapse increases entropy because the horizon has vastly more microstates than ordinary matter.

In the finite-resolution screen picture used here, continuous space is an effective approximation. The screen description is the fundamental descriptive layer.

## 3.13 Where We Go Next

We have established that:
- Gravitational entropy bounds and holographic arguments push strongly toward horizon-sensitive information organization and away from naive volume counting
- In the symmetric light-cone constructions used here, the effective screens are spherical as a consequence of causality
- The amount of information is finite, bounded by area
- Entanglement patterns on the screen create emergent 3D geometry

But we haven't yet explained dynamics. The screen we've described is static-it encodes information. What makes things happen? What creates the arrow of time?

The answer involves entropy again, this time in dynamics. The Second Law says entropy increases. But why? And what does this have to do with the screen?

In the next chapter, we explore the edge of the screen, the boundary conditions that govern what can happen. We will see how entropy growth is a geometric constraint built into the structure of horizons themselves, not only a statistical tendency.

Chapter 4 turns the screen from a storage surface into a thermodynamic one.
