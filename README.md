# Observer Patch Holography (OPH)

> Observer Patch Holography starts from one claim: no observer sees the whole world at once. Each observer accesses only a local patch, and neighboring patches must agree on their overlap. OPH asks how much physics follows from that demand alone.

**French version:** [README_FR.md](README_FR.md)

**Quick links:** [website](https://floatingpragma.io/oph/) | [OPH Textbooks](https://learn.floatingpragma.io/) | [OPH Lab](https://oph-lab.floatingpragma.io)

OPH is a reconstruction program for fundamental physics. Spacetime, gauge structure, particles, records, and observer synchronization are treated as consequences of overlap consistency on a finite holographic screen.

## What OPH Delivers

- A finite-resolution theorem package for observer patches, collars, overlap repair, higher gauge structure, records, and checkpoint/restoration.
- A conditional route to Lorentzian geometry, modular time, Jacobson-type Einstein dynamics, and de Sitter static-patch cosmology on the extracted prime geometric subnet; the remaining UV/BW scaffold is geometric cap-pair realization on that subnet plus ordered cut-pair rigidity, with the eventual fixed-local-collar modular-transport common floor as the smallest lower blocker.
- A conditional compact gauge route in the bosonic branch to the realized Standard Model quotient `SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) / Z_6`, together with the exact hypercharge lattice and the realized counting chain `N_g = 3`, `N_c = 3`.
- A particle program with exact structural massless carriers, a forward-emitted Phase II electroweak calibration branch with a closed target-free public `W/Z` theorem surface plus a compare-only exact frozen pair, a quantitative Higgs/top stage, exact non-hadron mass sidecars, and explicit continuation lanes for flavor and hadrons.
- A concrete screen-microphysics architecture that puts measurement, records, and observers inside the physics.

## Local Unification Surface

OPH places a local unification surface around the calibrated local UV input. The same `P`-driven scale carries the electroweak boson and Higgs lane together with the gravity-side entropy lane, while the Lorentz branch supplies the invariant causal speed and the local readout package supplies the SI display.

## Particle Highlights

### Theorem-grade and structural hits

- Exact structural zeros for the photon, gluons, and graviton.
- Electroweak output on the D10 calibration branch, with closed target-free public `W/Z` rows and an exact frozen compare-only pair
  `W = 80.377 GeV`, `Z = 91.18797809193725 GeV`.
- A quantitative Higgs/top stage downstream of the electroweak core, with a closed one-scalar forward seed carrying the public rows
  `H = 125.218922 GeV`, `t = 172.388646 GeV`.

### Exact non-hadron output surface

| Lane | Exact output(s) | Status note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structural carriers | `m_photon = m_gluon = m_graviton = 0` | theorem-grade structural exactness |
| Electroweak sidecar | `W = 80.377 GeV`, `Z = 91.18797809193725 GeV` | exact frozen repair surface |
| Higgs/top exact sidecar | `(H, t) = (125.1995304097179, 172.3523553288311) GeV` | exact compare-only inverse slice on the same Higgs/top Jacobian |
| Charged witness | `(e, mu, tau) = (0.00051099895, 0.1056583755, 1.7769324651340912) GeV` | exact same-family witness |
| Quark witness | `(u, d, s, c, b, t) = (0.00216, 0.00470, 0.0935, 1.273, 4.183, 172.3523553288311) GeV` | exact same-family witness |
| Neutrino theorem branch | `(m1, m2, m3) = (0.017454720257976796, 0.019481987935919015, 0.05307522145074924) eV` with emitted weighted-cycle `Δm21²`, `Δm31²`, `Δm32²` | theorem-grade weighted-cycle bridge-rigid absolute family |

Public Higgs/top rows are carried by the closed one-scalar forward seed. The exact inverse pair above is a compare-only sidecar on the same Jacobian and does not replace the public forward branch.

### Continuation-grade particle successes

- The quark continuation lane emits public rows for `u`, `d`, `s`, `c`, and `b` on the selected continuation branch.
- The neutrino weighted-cycle branch reaches the observed PMNS and hierarchy regime with
  `theta12 = 34.2259°`, `theta23 = 49.7228°`, `theta13 = 8.68636°`, `delta = 305.581°`,
  and `Δm21² / Δm32² = 0.03072111`.
- The exact non-hadron surface is collected in
  [code/particles/EXACT_NONHADRON_MASSES.md](code/particles/EXACT_NONHADRON_MASSES.md).
