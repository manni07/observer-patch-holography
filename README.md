# Observer Patch Holography (OPH)

> Observer Patch Holography starts from a simple restriction: no observer sees the whole world at once. Each observer gets only a local patch, and neighboring patches have to agree where those patches overlap. The question is how much physics can be forced from that fact alone.

OPH is a reconstruction program for fundamental physics. It starts from finite
observers on a finite holographic screen and works outward. Its working basis
is quantum-algebraic: patch algebras, states, trace/Born event probabilities on
declared record surfaces, and generalized entropy are part of the formal
starting point. The program is not a demand to derive every mathematical
ingredient from first principles. Its goal is to construct a consistent and
comprehensive theory of everything by using that algebraic-information basis
to recover the observed effective universe: spacetime, gauge structure,
particles, records, and observer synchronization are treated as consequences
of overlap consistency, not as primitives.

The operational claim is sharper than "information is fundamental." OPH models
reality as an observer-based fixed-point consensus process. Finite observer
patches carry local records, compare only what their overlaps expose, repair
mismatches through declared recovery moves, and settle into stable fixed points
that survive refinement. The public world is the overlap-stable output of that
process. In this sense, OPH treats reality as a computational process, not as a
static stage on which computation merely happens.

## What OPH Delivers

Most theories begin by assuming spacetime, quantum fields, and a list of
constants. OPH starts one step earlier than spacetime and quantum field theory,
with finite observers on a finite quantum-algebraic holographic screen whose
descriptions have to agree where their patches overlap. Push that requirement
hard enough and a `3+1D` Lorentzian spacetime emerges, together with a
Jacobson-style Einstein equation and the realized Standard Model quotient
`SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) / Z_6`, including the exact hypercharge lattice, the
realized color triplet `N_c = 3`, and the generation count `N_g = 3`. Quantum
mechanics is treated as the algebraic information language carried by the OPH
architecture. The reconstruction test is whether that basis coherently
recovers the effective universe, not whether every mathematical ingredient has
been derived from an empty starting point.

The mechanism is the fixed-point consensus loop. Local observers do not access
a global state from outside. They carry finite patch states, exchange
overlap-visible data, reject inconsistent continuations, and keep the stable
patterns that can be synchronized. Geometry, particles, laws, and records are
the large-scale fixed points of that observer-network computation.

The scale is set by two quantities: the total screen capacity
`N_scr = log dim H_tot`, read from the de Sitter horizon, and the local pixel
ratio `P = a_cell / l_P^2`, which fixes the size of one screen cell in Planck
areas. For the observed cosmological constant, the bare horizon area ratio is
`N_patch = (R_dS / l_P)^2 ≈ 1.05e122`, while the entropy capacity used by OPH is
`N_scr = pi N_patch ≈ 3.31e122`. From the outside, `P` is a geometric cell size that sits
slightly above the self-similar balance `φ = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2`. From the
inside, it becomes the smallest electromagnetic observation scale available to
observers in the world encoded on that screen. OPH finds the fine-structure
constant by asking for the nonzero detuning of a holographic screen cell such
that the cell's outer geometric displacement from perfect self-similar
equilibrium equals the electromagnetic observation scale emitted by the
universe living on that same screen. The closure is
`P = φ + α_in(P) sqrt(pi)`. For the 2022 CODATA/NIST central value
`α⁻¹(0) = 137.035999177`, that outer formula gives
`P = 1.630968209403959...`. The same fixed-point geometry is also probed in a
separate optical-cavity hardware note.

From the same setup come gravity, gauge structure, a tiered particle surface,
records, and observer synchronization. The particle pipeline records the
candidate values `P = 1.63097210492078846050203640439` and
`alpha_cand^-1 = 136.994020662724205139718642793`. This root is outside the
live prediction tier. The weak-boson pair is compare-only; live promotion
requires the Ward-projected Thomson endpoint and RG/matching certificates. The
Higgs lane, selected-class quark rows, and weighted-cycle neutrino branch are
separate scoped outputs. The available derivation gives no-go boundaries for
charged-lepton absolute masses, global quark-frame classification, and the
auxiliary direct-top conversion. Hadron masses belong to the OPH hadron-backend
problem. The hadron backend entries have out-of-scope/computationally blocked
status. Reopening requires a working OPH hadron backend such as
GLORB/Echosahedron with production spectral data and systematics.

### Selected Quantitative Rows

This table keeps the rows that are easiest to compare directly with PDG and
NIST values. Structural results such as the `3+1D` Lorentzian spacetime, the
Standard Model quotient `SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) / Z_6`, the exact hypercharge
lattice, the realized color triplet `N_c = 3`, and the generation count
`N_g = 3` live in the papers. The
quick view here sticks to direct numeric rows and exact zeros.

| Quantity | Symbol | OPH | PDG/NIST | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Gravitational constant | G | 6.6742999959e-11 | 6.67430(15)e-11 | 0.00003σ |
| Speed of light | c | 299792458 | 299792458 (exact) | match |
| Fine-structure (inv) | α⁻¹(0) | candidate trunk gives 136.994020662724 | 137.035999177(21) | endpoint/matching gate open |
| Photon mass | m_γ | 0 eV | <1e-18 eV | below bound |
| Gluon mass | m_g | 0 GeV | 0 GeV | match |
| Graviton mass | m_grav | 0 eV | <1.76e-23 eV | below bound |

**Quark sector**

| Quark | Symbol | OPH | PDG | Δ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bottom | m_b(m_b) | 4.183 GeV | 4.183 ± 0.007 | match |
| Charm | m_c(m_c) | 1.273 GeV | 1.2730 ± 0.0046 | match |
| Strange | m_s(2 GeV) | 93.5 MeV | 93.5 ± 0.8 | match |
| Down | m_d(2 GeV) | 4.70 MeV | 4.70 ± 0.07 | match |
| Up | m_u(2 GeV) | 2.16 MeV | 2.16 ± 0.07 | match |
| Top | m_t cross-section row | 172.35235532883115 GeV | 172.3523553288312 | selected-class match |

`Δ` reports the sigma distance where PDG or NIST quotes a one-standard-deviation
uncertainty. Otherwise it records `match` or `below bound`.

For quarks, PDG uses its standard mass conventions: `u`, `d`, and `s` at
`2 GeV`, with `c` and `b` in the `MS` scheme at their own mass scale. The
papers also carry the structural Standard Model derivations listed above and a
neutrino family, but those do not collapse to one simple PDG or NIST row and
are left out of this table.

The particle surface also reports compare-only `W/Z` values `80.377 GeV` and
`91.18797809193725 GeV`, a Higgs value `m_H = 125.1995304097179 GeV`, and a
selected-class top value `m_t = 172.35235532883115 GeV` using the PDG
cross-section top-mass convention. The auxiliary direct-top average is
compare-only. Charged-lepton values are target-anchored witness rows outside
the promoted prediction tier. The weighted-cycle neutrino branch emits
`(0.017454720257976796, 0.019481987935919015, 0.05307522145074924) eV` on its
declared branch.

## Local Unification Surface

The local unification surface is organized around the candidate pixel ratio
`P` and one local ruler, `a_cell`. On that surface the same scale touches the
electroweak comparison lane, the Higgs lane, the gravity-side entropy relation,
and the familiar unit readout for meters, seconds, GeV, and Kelvin. The diagram
below shows how those pieces sit on one scale. The detailed formulas and claim
tiers live in the papers.
