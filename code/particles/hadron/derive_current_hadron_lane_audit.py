"""Summarize the live hadron frontier and the next missing constructive object.

Chain role: classify the active hadron path so the project can tell whether the
remaining blocker is ensemble seeding, cfg/source realization, convergence, or
resonance extraction.

Mathematics: rule-based pipeline classification only; this file does not derive
hadron masses itself.

OPH-derived inputs: the statuses of the active `/particles` hadron artifacts.

Output: the current hadron frontier report consumed by the public surface and
completion planning.
