"""Build the `/particles`-native public prediction surface.

Chain role: assemble the live per-sector outputs from the active local
derivation chain into one public candidate-or-gap table.

Mathematics: this file does not derive masses itself; it applies promotion
policy, ledger mapping, residual reporting, and surface provenance rules.

OPH-derived inputs: the local `/particles` calibration, flavor, neutrino, and
hadron artifacts only. No legacy ancillary predictor surface is imported here.

Output: `RESULTS_STATUS.md`, `results_status.json`, and the machine-readable

    "The selected current-carrier chart is closed and remains explicit on disk, but the active public electroweak surface is now the target-free source-only theorem `EWTargetFreeRepairValueLaw_D10`. "
    "That theorem emits the repaired chart `(tau2_tree_exact, delta_n_tree_exact)` from the D10 source basis alone using `lambda_EW = eta_source^2 / (4 * beta_EW)`, then emits one coherent electroweak quintet from one repaired coupling pair. "
    "So the public D10 W/Z values are no longer freeze-once rows. The older freeze-once coherent repair law is retained only as compare-only validation and agrees with the target-free theorem to machine scale: about `+1.54e-08` GeV on `W` and `-1.40e-08` GeV on `Z`. "
    "This closes the electroweak mass-side lane on the Phase II calibration tier; the earlier source-only underdetermination theorem, minimal conditional route through `ColorBalancedQuadraticRepairDescent_D10`, and former candidate `EWTargetEmitter_D10` remain on disk only as historical scaffolding beneath the promoted theorem."

    "`eta_source_support_extension_log_per_side` and then "
    "`sigma_source_support_extension_total_log_per_side`, with the smaller ordered source-scalar pair readback now explicit on disk. "
    "A representation-consistent absolute-scale shell is also explicit: future charged scale code must emit either "
    "`mu_e_absolute_log_candidate` or `g_e_linear_candidate` and convert exactly once via `g_e = exp(mu_e_absolute_log_candidate)`. "
    "But the present charged theorem still fixes only the centered charged log class modulo a common shift, so the absolute scale `g_e` remains unresolved on the live theorem lane. "
    "At theorem level, the exact waiting set is sharper than a standalone eta/sigma fit: the charged sector-response object is still only the latent candidate `C_hat_e^{cand}`, not a declared theorem-grade operator. Promoting that candidate is blocked by the upstream theorem `oph_generation_bundle_branch_generator_splitting`, reduced further to the clause `compression_descendant_commutator_vanishes_or_is_uniformly_quadratic_small_after_central_split`. The local corpus proves neither exact vanishing nor uniform quadratic smallness of that descended commutator yet; only the desired transfer bridge is specified. On the absolute side, the charged equalizer route is now an explicit no-go under common-shift symmetry: the current theorem emits only the quotient class of charged logs modulo `(1,1,1)`, so no theorem-grade `g_e` or `Delta_e_abs` exists yet. The single honest future slot is one affine-covariant absolute charged anchor `A_ch` satisfying `A_ch(logm + c*(1,1,1)) = A_ch(logm) + c`; then `g_e = exp(A_ch)` and `Delta_e_abs = log(g_ch_shared) - A_ch`. "
    "The sharpest new constructive route is only an extension candidate, not a current-corpus closure: if the actual centered compressed generator factors through centered Schur-type `P->Q->P` feedback with a refinement-uniform middle-factor bound, then the transfer gap closes exactly when the descended commutator vanishes and otherwise only quadratically. On the current local certificate, the proxy margin would survive such an extension whenever the uniform bound satisfies about `M < 119.5600535277701`. That route would promote `C_hat_e^{cand}`, but it still would not emit `A_ch` by itself. "
    "A D12 continuation bridge exists under the extra assumptions A1-A3 and gives eta = -6.729586682888832 and sigma = 8.154061112725994 with near-exact centered-log shape closure, "
    "but the theorem-grade lane still lacks emitted eta, sigma, and absolute scale. On that continuation bridge the compare-only absolute target would be `g_e* = 0.04577885783568762`, equivalently `Delta_e_abs* = 3.003986333402356`, and that target is kept strictly non-promotable until a theorem-grade absolute anchor `A_ch` exists on the live branch."

    "the pure-`B` payload pair "

    "the mass side reduces to `Delta_ud_overlap` together with the quadratic-even scalar `eta_Q_centered`, and the mixing side closes on the same D12 branch because the forward Yukawa step already emits the same-label transport unitary `V_CKM^fwd = U_u^dagger U_d`, whose principal logarithm yields the honest generator `K_CKM`. "
    "On the current same-family continuation branch, the exact mass-side reduction sharpens to the emitted ray `D12_ud_mass_ray`, with `Delta_ud_overlap = ray_modulus / 5` and `eta_Q_centered = -((1 - x2^2) / 27) * ray_modulus`; that is a real structural reduction on the current sheet. "
    "The strongest current exact-mean specialization gives "
    "`alpha_u = 1.0007763698011345`, `alpha_d = 1.008463281557513`, "

    "with RMS log-mass error about `5.21e-05`, but those values remain compare-derived rather than OPH-emitted. "
    "The retained same-family numerical point on the emitted ray is sample-only: `t1_sample = ray_modulus = 0.6695617711471163`, giving `Delta_ud_overlap = 0.13391235422942327` and `eta_Q_centered = -0.018155152181872827`. "
    "But the current D12 sheet is now an explicit no-go for the physical CKM shell: same-sheet rephasing leaves CKM invariants frozen, and the emitted angles undershoot the comparison shell by factors about `29.68`, `34.02`, and `117.06`. "
    "The current local surface is formally insufficient to identify that selector: only one reference-sheet representative is emitted, while no finite `Sigma_ud` orbit or `sigma -> CKM` evaluator is exposed. The only finite local scan now on disk is a 4001-point same-sheet `Delta_ud_overlap` scan against `reference_targets`; it is comparison-only and cannot honestly serve as a `Sigma_ud` selector route. "
    "A smaller already-local finite basis orbit has also been exposed and ruled out: swapping in right or conjugate-right singular bases can move CKM moduli, but that orbit leaves the ordered same-label left-eigenframe domain and is therefore diagnostic-only. "
    "So the exact next quark object is one discrete `quark_relative_sheet_selector`, and the minimal solver extension is an emitted finite left-handed same-label `sigma_ud_orbit` carrying per-candidate CKM tuples. Only after the physical branch is selected does the mass-side scale question remain, via a selected-branch intrinsic scale law independent of target masses and independent of CKM/CP."

    "The strongest honest repaired branch on disk is therefore the shared-basis weighted cycle lift: using the live same-label scalar certificate `(gap_e, overlap_sq_e)`, the live flavor cocycle invariants `gamma` and `eps`, and the live selector phases, it emits the repaired edge law `w_e = q_e^(1 + gamma + eps)` with diagonal load `chi = 1 + eps`. "
    "That repaired branch lands in the current PDG oscillation window at the dimensionless pattern level, with `theta12 = 33.9756 deg`, `theta23 = 49.7785 deg`, `theta13 = 8.64594 deg`, `delta = 307.818 deg`, and `J = -0.02652`; its predicted splitting ratio is `Delta m21^2 / Delta m32^2 = 0.0316024`. "
    "No hidden discrete branch remains on that repaired lane: the remaining freedom is purely the positive rescaling orbit `lambda_nu > 0`. "
    "But one overall positive neutrino normalization remains open on the live theorem lane, so absolute neutrino masses and absolute `Delta m^2` values are still compare-only unless an external atmospheric anchor is supplied. "
    "The sharpened no-go statement is that the repaired weighted-cycle branch emits only the one-parameter absolute family `m_i = lambda_nu * mhat_i`, `Delta m^2_ij = lambda_nu^2 * Delta_hat_ij`; all PMNS data and dimensionless hierarchy ratios are unchanged across that family, so no unique theorem-grade absolute spectrum exists yet. "
    "A compare-only single-scale fit sharpens that boundary further: fitting `lambda_nu` against PDG 2025 central splittings gives a good one-parameter oscillation match, but exact simultaneous central-value closure is impossible on the current repaired branch because the fixed ratio `Delta_hat_21 / Delta_hat_32 = 0.0316024` sits about `2.87%` above the representative PDG central ratio. The weighted least-squares fit gives `lambda_nu = 1.78358`, `m = (0.01730, 0.01939, 0.05299) eV`, with residuals about `+1.00 sigma` on `Delta m21^2` and `-0.32 sigma` on `Delta m32^2`. "
    "A separate compare-only law-space audit records stronger candidate exponent laws, including a midpoint-normalized candidate that lands essentially on the representative central splitting ratio while keeping the PMNS angles in the physical window, but those candidates remain unpromoted until their coefficients are emitted by the theorem surface rather than inferred from comparison. "
    "With the compare-only anchor `Delta m32^2 = 2.433e-3 eV^2`, the repaired branch gives `m = (0.01730, 0.01940, 0.05300) eV` and `Delta m21^2 = 7.689e-5 eV^2`. These rows therefore remain unpromoted as exact OPH mass predictions until that single normalization scalar is emitted."
