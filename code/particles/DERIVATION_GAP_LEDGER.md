## Bundle Execution Plan

The remaining work is grouped into coupled closure packets rather than a one-blocker-at-a-time queue.

| Bundle | Status | Gaps | Promotion question |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `electroweak-root-closure-bundle` | `constructive_endpoint_contract_emitted` | `pclosure.compressed-trunk-artifact`, `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint`, `d10.rg-matching-threshold-scheme`, `pclosure.live-codepath-adoption` | Can one source-emitted map Delta_Th(P), with declared matching and interval bounds, certify the compressed P trunk as the live particle root without importing alpha(0)? |
| `spectrum-source-bundle` | `constructive_trace_lift_schema_emitted` | `charged.determinant-normalization-transport`, `quark.selected-class-vs-global-classification`, `neutrino.pmns-status-and-absolute-rows` | Is there one OPH excitation dictionary and sector-isolated trace-lift theorem that explains the charged affine anchor, quark selected-class boundary, and neutrino PMNS comparison surface without hidden target fitting? |
| `qcd-thomson-backend-bundle` | `constructive_spectral_measure_contract_emitted` | `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint`, `hadron.production-backend-systematics` | Can the hadron production backend emit the rho_had(s;P) object and uncertainty budget needed by the Ward-projected Thomson endpoint, rather than leaving hadrons and alpha(0) as separate deferred gaps? |
| `particle-root-integration-gate` | `keep_candidate_with_constructive_next_artifacts` | `pclosure.compressed-trunk-artifact`, `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint`, `d10.rg-matching-threshold-scheme`, `pclosure.live-codepath-adoption`, `charged.determinant-normalization-transport`, `quark.selected-class-vs-global-classification`, `neutrino.pmns-status-and-absolute-rows`, `hadron.production-backend-systematics` | Do the returned packets jointly close the endpoint, matching, interval, and source-object requirements strongly enough to promote the compressed trunk into live particle builders? |

## Bundle Packet Results

- `electroweak-root-closure-bundle`: `constructive_endpoint_contract_emitted`. Constructive result. The admissible endpoint object is now explicit: Delta_Th(P) must split into source lepton transport, a Ward-projected hadronic spectral density rho_had(s;P), a certified electroweak/scheme remainder, RG/matching certificates, quadrature bounds, and an interval-level fixed-point certificate. The local implementation target is P_derivation/runtime/thomson_endpoint_contract_current.json.
- `spectrum-source-bundle`: `constructive_trace_lift_schema_emitted`. Constructive result. SourceNormalizedTraceLiftDescent is the reusable schema to implement next. Charged leptons still need N_det(P)=0, quarks remain selected-class on f_P, and neutrino PMNS rows remain visible comparison-tension rows.
- `qcd-thomson-backend-bundle`: `constructive_spectral_measure_contract_emitted`. Constructive result. The current stable-channel backend is not the endpoint object. The smallest missing primitive is production_ward_projected_hadronic_spectral_measure_export with continuum, volume, chiral, statistical, matching, quadrature, and endpoint budgets. The local implementation target is particles/hadron/ward_projected_spectral_measure.schema.json.
- `particle-root-integration-gate`: `keep_candidate_with_constructive_next_artifacts`. No promotion. The first wave now emits constructive next artifacts, so the compressed P trunk remains candidate/audit metadata until those artifacts are populated and certified.

## Remaining Gaps

| ID | Lane | Status | Issue | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pclosure.compressed-trunk-artifact` | P closure | `candidate_artifact` | #224 | Keep emitting p_closure_trunk_current.json and use it only as audit metadata for now. |
| `d10.ward-projected-thomson-endpoint` | D10 electromagnetic endpoint | `open_theorem_gap` | #223 | Derive Delta_Th(P) from the same Ward-projected source family as a0(P), including rho_had(s;P), matching remainder, and certified quadrature bounds. |
| `d10.rg-matching-threshold-scheme` | D10 running and matching | `open_theorem_gap` | #32 | Turn the running/matching package into an OPH edge-sector theorem or explicitly keep it as a declared convention in every prediction surface. |
| `pclosure.live-codepath-adoption` | P closure | `blocked_pending_certified_root` | #224 | After issues 223 and 32 close, switch live particle builders to the certified trunk artifact and make compare-only or historical P paths non-default. |
| `charged.determinant-normalization-transport` | Charged leptons | `open_source_theorem` | n/a | Prove 3 mu(r) = sum_e M_e^ch log q_e(r), equivalently zero normalization defect N_det(P), on the physical charged branch. |
| `quark.selected-class-vs-global-classification` | Quarks | `selected_class_closed_global_classification_open` | #198 | Either prove the global frame-class classification or keep every public exact-quark claim explicitly selected-class. |
| `neutrino.pmns-status-and-absolute-rows` | Neutrinos | `theorem_rows_with_visible_comparison_tension` | #117 | Do not hide PMNS residuals behind the exact absolute-splitting rows; either prove a better branch or leave the comparison tension explicit. |
| `hadron.production-backend-systematics` | Hadrons | `deferred_execution_contract` | #153 | Implement/run the production backend dump path, validate writeback, and publish continuum/volume/chiral/statistical budgets. |

## Claim Policy

- The compressed P trunk is an audit/candidate artifact until the endpoint and certificate gates close.
- The remaining blockers should be worked as coupled bundles, not as isolated one-off fixes.
- The particle pipeline must keep compare-only, continuation, selected-class, and theorem-grade rows mechanically distinct.
- Golden-ratio torus or resonance language is not a live derivation input unless a separate representation-to-spectrum theorem is supplied.
